Coding Standards
==========================

DroneKit-Python does not impose (or recommend) a particular set of coding standards
for third party code.

Internally we run the `YAPF formatter <https://github.com/google/yapf#introduction>`_
on major releases and we expect contributors to copy the patterns used in similar
code within the existing code base.
