===========================================
Welcome to DroneKit-Python's documentation!
===========================================

DroneKit-Python 2.x helps you create powerful apps for UAVs. These apps run on a UAV's :ref:`Companion Computer <supported-companion-computers>`, and augment the autopilot by performing tasks that are both computationally intensive and require a low-latency link (e.g. computer vision). 

This documentation provides everything you need to get started with DroneKit-Python, including an :doc:`overview <about/overview>` of the API, quick start, guide material, a number of demos and examples, 
and :doc:`API Reference <automodule>`. 

.. tip::

    *DroneKit-Python version 1.5* has now been superseded (see these links for legacy `documentation <http://python.dronekit.io/1.5.0/>`_ 
    and `examples <https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/tree/81bbd80076fb212c9305751333d9924e6b762434/examples>`_).
